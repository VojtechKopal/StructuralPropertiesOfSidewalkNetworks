abstract="A large class of computational problems involve the determination of properties of graphs, digraphs, integers, arrays of integers, finite families of finite sets, boolean formulas and elements of other countable domains. Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.",

Here “reduced” means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed.},

abstract = {From a transport perspective, increasing active travel –and walking in particular– is crucial for the future of sustainable cities, as reflected in global decarbonisation policies and agendas. Further, walking is much more than a mere mode of transport: it provides a fundamental social function, fostering vibrant cohesive communities. Arguably, walking and its associated infrastructure –sidewalks– should rank among the highest priorities for planning authorities. However, efficiency- and speed-driven urbanisation has gradually reallocated street space to private cars, leading to automobiles being the prioritised mode of transport today. Empirical research has generally followed suit, and a systemic understanding of walking as a phenomenon is largely missing, i.e., questions like how connected, resilient, accessible, or socially equitable is the pedestrian infrastructure of whole neighbourhoods and cities. Such relative neglect of sidewalk network research is, first and foremost, the consequence of a generalised lack of publicly available data on sidewalk infrastructure worldwide. A second reason might be its apparent lack of interest from a systemic standpoint: pedestrian mobility does not produce coordination challenges on the scale that cars do. In this work, we confront this perception by showing that there is ample research potential in the study of system-wide sidewalk networks, with both structural and dynamical challenges which might be critical to pursue the latest aspirations towards sustainable mobility in cities.}

    abstract = { A recent trend in parameterized algorithms is the application of polytope tools to fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms [e.g., Cygan et al., FOCS 2011, 52nd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, IEEE, 2011, pp. 150--159; Narayanaswamy et al., STACS 2012, Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science, 2012, pp. 338--349]. Although this approach has yielded significant speedups for a range of important problems, it requires the underlying polytope to have very restrictive properties, including half-integrality and Nemhauser--Trotter-style persistence properties. To date, these properties are essentially known to hold only for two classes of polytopes, covering the cases of Vertex Cover [Nemhauser and Trotter, Math. Program., 8 (1975), pp. 232--248] and Node Multiway Cut [Garg et al., J. Alg., 50 (2004), pp. 49--61]. Taking a slightly different approach, we view half-integrality as a discrete relaxation of a problem, e.g., a relaxation of the search space from \$\{0,1\}^V\$ to \$\{0,1/2,1\}^V\$ such that the new problem admits a polynomial-time exact solution. Using tools from constraint satisfaction problems [in particular Thapper and Živný, FOCS 2012, 53rd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, IEEE, 2012, pp. 669--678] to study the existence of such relaxations, we are able to provide a much broader class of half-integral polytopes with the required properties. Our results unify and significantly extend the previously known cases, and yield a range of new and improved FPT algorithms, including an \$O^*(|\Sigma|^{2k})\$-time algorithm for node-deletion Unique Label Cover and an \$O^*(4^k)\$-time algorithm for Group Feedback Vertex Set where the group is given by oracle access. The latter result also implies the first single-exponential time FPT algorithm for Subset Feedback Vertex Set, answering an open question of Cygan et al. [Algorithmica, 74 (2016), pp. 630--642]. Additionally, we propose a network-flow-based approach to solve several cases of the relaxation problem. This gives the first linear-time FPT algorithm to edge-deletion Unique Label Cover. }

abstract = {With the increasing demand for sustainability, walking is being encouraged as one of the main active modes of transportation. However, pedestrians are vulnerable to severe injuries when involved in crashes which can discourage road users from walking. Therefore, studying factors that affect the safety of pedestrians is important. This paper investigates the relationship between pedestrian-motorist crashes and various sidewalk network indicators in the city of Vancouver. The goal is to assess the impact of network connectivity, directness, and topography on pedestrian safety using macro-level collision prediction models. The models were developed using generalized linear regression and full Bayesian techniques. Both walking trips and vehicle kilometers travelled were used as the main traffic exposure variables in the models. The safety models supported the safety in numbers hypothesis showing a non-linear positive association between pedestrian-motorist crashes and the increase in walking trips and vehicle traffic. The model results also suggested that higher continuity, linearity, coverage, and slope of sidewalk networks were associated with lower crash occurrence. However, network connectivity was associated with higher crash occurrence. The spatial effects were accounted for in the full Bayes models and were found significant. The models provide insights about the factors that influence pedestrian safety and the spatial variability of pedestrian crashes within a city, which can be useful for the planning of pedestrian networks.}
